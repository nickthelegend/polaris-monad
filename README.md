# Polaris

**Stripe for every app on Monad.** One link to get paid now, later, or every
month.

- **The Polaris app** (buyers and senders): open a link, create an account with
  Face ID ([Mera](https://docs.monad.xyz/guides/mera) passkeys), and pay in
  dollars (AUSD). Pay in full, in four instalments against a credit line read
  from your on-chain history, or on a subscription, send dollars across
  borders by link, and split a bill with one link (each friend pays their
  share, straight to whoever paid). No wallet, no gas, no seed phrase.
- **Polaris for Business** (merchants and platforms): payment links, a checkout
  API and SDK, a collections dashboard, webhooks, and one-tap or automatic
  payouts. Built on [Privy](https://privy.io).
- **The credit engine**: undercollateralized Pay in 4 on Monad at 10% APR (a
  $200 order is 4 × $50.38, nothing due at checkout). The merchant is paid in
  full up front. Credit is underwritten, instalments are collected (and
  retried the moment a buyer signs again), and new Pay in 4 plans are paused
  when Chainlink's AUSD/USD depegs or the pool runs short, by three
  [Chainlink CRE](https://docs.chain.link/cre) workflows, using
  [Nansen](https://nansen.ai) and Zerion wallet data, and indexed by
  [Envio](https://envio.dev).

Built for [Monad Metropolis](https://monad.xyz/developers/hackathons/metropolis),
Track 02: Consumer Products & Payments. The plan is in
[`docs/plan.md`](docs/plan.md).

> **Status (28 Sep 2026):** Polaris is live on **Monad testnet**. Every
> contract is deployed and wired, and read back on chain (65 of 65). The
> relayer is now a **policy-locked Privy server wallet**, and the smoke test
> ran every buyer and merchant action through it on Monad testnet, 14 of 14:
> registration, Pay now, Pay in 4, a subscription, an early instalment, a
> re-signed approval, a send by link and its claim, and a one-tap withdraw,
> with five fresh accounts that never held MON
> ([the run](docs/demo/testnet/README.md)). The CRE guardian's receiver and
> CollateralVault were redeployed the same day (still 65 of 65). The addresses are in
> [Monad testnet deployment](#monad-testnet-deployment). The dollar there is
> a clearly labelled **mock** (`MockAUSD`), because the deployer held no
> testnet AUSD. The whole product also runs end to end on a local chain with
> one command (`pnpm demo:local`, below). The Chainlink CRE workflows ran
> with the CRE CLI (`simulate --broadcast`) and delivered **three signed
> reports on Monad testnet**: an instant collection on an EVM log trigger, a
> scheduled collection, and a guardian attestation that reads Chainlink's
> AUSD/USD feed on Monad mainnet
> ([the runs](#cre-runs-on-monad-testnet-28-sep-2026)).

## Why Monad

- **Pay in 4 is many small writes.** One plan is an origination, four
  collections and their retries. That only works where each write is cheap
  and final: Monad makes a block every 400 ms and finalises in about 800 ms.
- **Checkout and remittance need instant finality.** "Paid" and "Arrived"
  show before the popup closes; there is no pending state for the buyer.
- **EVM-equivalent.** The hardened Solidity from our earlier work runs unchanged, so the
  window went into product, not porting.
- **Dollars with signature approvals.** AUSD supports ERC-2612 and ERC-3009,
  so every buyer action is a signature and the relayer pays the gas: no
  account abstraction, no MON for users.
- **Monad-specific gas handling.** Monad bills the gas *limit*, so the
  relayer sets each limit to `eth_estimateGas` plus 15%
  ([`submit.ts`](apps/business/src/server/relayer/submit.ts)) instead of a
  padded default.
- **Passkey accounts are Monad-native.** Monad's docs ship Mera, which turns
  Face ID into a normal account with nothing to deploy.

## Submission

The Metropolis submission kit is in [`docs/submission`](docs/submission):

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`writeup.md`](docs/submission/writeup.md) | The write-up: the problem, the product, the first five minutes, how it works, what's new since the foundation import, and one heading per bounty with its requirement, where it is met (code and Monad testnet transactions) and what is not done yet |
| [`bounty-fields.md`](docs/submission/bounty-fields.md) | Ready-to-paste answers for each bounty's portal fields |
| [`video-script.md`](docs/submission/video-script.md) | The 3-minute demo: shot list, on-screen text, the command behind each scene |
| [`profile.md`](docs/submission/profile.md) | Name, one-liner, 50- and 150-word descriptions, track, bounties, tech stack, team |
| [`diffstat.txt`](docs/submission/diffstat.txt) | `git diff --stat` from the foundation import (`85b29e4`), by folder and in full (`pnpm docs:diffstat` regenerates it) |
| [`sources.md`](docs/submission/sources.md) | Where each requirement comes from, and what needs the logged-in portal to confirm |

Also: [`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md) (the index), [`docs/SPONSOR-GAP.md`](docs/SPONSOR-GAP.md) (each bounty's requirement and what's left) and [`docs/DEPLOY-LATER.md`](docs/DEPLOY-LATER.md) (the runbook for the deploys still to come).

`pnpm docs:check` ([`scripts/check-docs-links.mjs`](scripts/check-docs-links.mjs))
checks every link in this README and the kit, and every hash and address in
the kit against the committed deployment and CRE records.

## Run it

Node 22.6+ and pnpm 10.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm demo:local
```

`pnpm demo:local` ([`scripts/demo-local.mjs`](scripts/demo-local.mjs)) starts
everything on this machine, with nothing live (no Privy login, no CRE login,
no public chain):

| What | Where | How it runs |
|---|---|---|
| A Hardhat node, chain 31337 | http://127.0.0.1:8545 | every contract deployed by `packages/contracts/scripts/deploy-monad.js` (MockAUSD, a funded credit pool, a local CRE forwarder) |
| Polaris for Business | http://localhost:3100 | the dev relayer adapter (a local key held to the production relayer policy), a fresh SQLite store, Halcyon's merchant seeded with test API keys and a webhook, registered on `MerchantRegistry` through the dashboard's registration API; the dashboard is signed in for Halcyon with a random local session |
| The CRE underwriting trigger | http://127.0.0.1:2000/trigger | `workflows` `trigger:local`: the real `polaris-underwrite` handler on the CRE SDK's test runtime, with fixture evidence |
| The Polaris app | http://localhost:3000 | the hosted checkout; the dev signer stands in for Face ID (badge on every screen) |
| Halcyon, the demo shop | http://127.0.0.1:3600 | `polarispay-sdk` against the real API and checkout |
| A faucet | http://127.0.0.1:3650/mint | test dollars; the app's **Add money** offers it on this chain |
| The CRE collections workflow | every minute, and on every `Reauthorized` | `workflows` `collections:local`: the real `polaris-collections` handler on the CRE SDK's test runtime, on both its triggers: the cron collects due Pay in 4 instalments through `CollectionsReceiver` (and dunns what fails), and the EVM log trigger on `PolarisCheckout.Reauthorized` collects a buyer the moment they sign again; it reports each run to the API (the dashboard's Collections card and Chainlink page, `installment.collected` webhooks) and logs to `.demo/logs/cre-collections.log` |
| The CRE guardian | every minute | `workflows` `guardian:local`: the real `polaris-guardian` handler, reading **Chainlink's AUSD/USD on Monad mainnet** (public RPC, reads only; `DEMO_GUARDIAN_PRICE=mock` for the labelled local mock) and the pool on the local chain, and attesting to `GuardianReceiver`, which `PolarisCheckout.openPlan` asks before every new plan; `.demo/logs/cre-guardian.log` |

Then: open the shop, add something to the bag, **check out with Polaris**. The
checkout opens in a popup (the app's `/pay/[id]` sheet). Pay now, or choose
Pay in 4: a new buyer has no line, so **Raise your limit** runs the CRE
underwriting workflow first. The shop's order is marked paid by the Polaris
webhook, and the merchant dashboard at http://localhost:3100/dashboard shows
the payment and the plan. Before it prints its URLs, `demo:local` opens every
page and API route once, so no first click waits for `next dev` to compile.
`DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1` makes Pay in 4 instalments a minute apart instead of a
week (and the loan engine's grace 15 minutes, so a missed payment is dunned before it is liquidated), so the collections run shows on camera (instalment 1 is collected about
two minutes after checkout; Pay in 4's 10% APR is pro-rated over those minutes, so the plan shows $0.00 interest). Ports move with `DEMO_NODE_PORT`,
`DEMO_BUSINESS_PORT`, `DEMO_APP_PORT`, `DEMO_SHOP_PORT`, `DEMO_TRIGGER_PORT`
and `DEMO_FAUCET_PORT`. Logs and state are in `.demo/`; `.demo/demo.json`
has every URL of the run.

`pnpm demo:e2e` ([`scripts/demo-e2e.cjs`](scripts/demo-e2e.cjs), needs
Playwright: `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=<path>`, and `CHROMIUM=<chrome.exe>` if its
browser build isn't installed) drives that run headless and writes the
screenshots in [`docs/demo`](docs/demo). It finds the run's URLs in
`.demo/demo.json` (or `APP`, `SHOP`, `BUSINESS`, `RPC` and `FAUCET`). The committed ones are from a run in
which all 24 steps passed (the `x-*` screens were captured right after, on the
same run):

| After the run: a send link from "Maya" (name asked once), claimed on a new phone, "Your link was claimed"; Home, Activity, Credit, the dashboard at 1280 and 390 | [`x-1440-send-confirm`](docs/demo/x-1440-send-confirm.png), [`x-1440-send-link-ready`](docs/demo/x-1440-send-link-ready.png), [`x-390-claim-open`](docs/demo/x-390-claim-open.png), [`x-1440-notifications`](docs/demo/x-1440-notifications.png), [`x-1440-home`](docs/demo/x-1440-home.png), [`x-1440-activity`](docs/demo/x-1440-activity.png), [`x-1440-credit-score`](docs/demo/x-1440-credit-score.png), [`x-1280-dashboard-overview`](docs/demo/x-1280-dashboard-overview.png), [`x-1280-dashboard-payments`](docs/demo/x-1280-dashboard-payments.png), [`x-390-dashboard-payments`](docs/demo/x-390-dashboard-payments.png), [`x-1280-landing`](docs/demo/x-1280-landing.png) |

**Split the bill.** `pnpm demo:e2e:split`
([`scripts/demo-e2e-split.cjs`](scripts/demo-e2e-split.cjs); `pnpm demo:e2e`
runs it too, after its own steps) plays it against the same run with four
browser profiles. Maya splits a $200 dinner five ways on her phone (her own
share stays hers) and shares one link. Sam opens it on a laptop with no
account: Pay with Face ID makes his account in the same step and tells him to
add $40 before anything is signed; he adds test dollars and pays. Priya pays
hers on a phone. Maya sees 2 of 4 paid and $80 in her account, in Activity
on the phone and the desktop, and closes the split; Jon opens it afterwards
and owes nothing. A second split, by named amounts, is paid in full. Each
share is `PolarisSplit.payShare` on the local chain, relayed; every step is
checked against the chain and `GET /api/public/splits/{id}`: 22 of 22, with
the screens at 402×877 and 1440×900 in
[`docs/design/split`](docs/design/split/README.md). In the app, **Split a
bill** is in Home's More sheet (on the desktop, in the Send widget and
Activity's Your splits).

### Each app on its own

[`.claude/launch.json`](.claude/launch.json) has all four dev servers:

| App | Command | Port |
|---|---|---|
| The Polaris app | `pnpm --filter @polaris/app dev` (`next dev -p 3000`) | 3000 |
| Polaris for Business | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business dev` | 3100 |
| The Polaris landing page | `pnpm --filter @polaris/landing dev` | 3200 |
| Halcyon, the demo shop | `pnpm --filter @polaris/shop dev` | 3600 |

On their own, without `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLARIS_API_URL`, the app is an offline
demo and says so on every screen ("Demo mode · sample data, nothing is on
chain"); the dashboard has no sign-in until Privy is configured (its setup
screen says what to set; `pnpm demo:local` signs in its seeded merchant
instead); and the shop says payments aren't configured (it pays only through
Polaris for Business). Each app's README lists its environment.

### Deploy it

[`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) takes the four apps to public HTTPS, step
by step, with every command and every environment variable: the Polaris app,
the landing page and Halcyon on Vercel (each app's `vercel.json`; the shop's
orders in Upstash Redis), and Polaris for Business as one Docker container
with a volume on Fly.io ([`apps/business/fly.toml`](apps/business/fly.toml),
[`Dockerfile`](apps/business/Dockerfile); Railway works too). Then one
command checks the whole deployment: HTTPS, the apps wired to each other, no
development switch in a public build, CORS, and everything on the Monad
testnet deployment the SDK presets carry:

```bash
node scripts/deploy-check.mjs --app https://… --business https://… --landing https://… --shop https://…
```

### Tests and builds

| Package | Command | Result on this branch |
|---|---|---|
| Contracts | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts test` | 601 passing (PolarisSplit's tests among them) |
| `polarispay-sdk` | `pnpm --filter polarispay-sdk test`, `build` | 157 passing; ESM and CJS builds |
| Underwriting | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/underwriting test`, `typecheck`, `build` | 263 passing |
| Gateway | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/gateway test` | 7 passing |
| `@polaris/db` | `pnpm --filter @polaris/db test` | 31 passing |
| Receipts keys | `pnpm --filter @polaris/receipts test`, `typecheck` | 16 passing (derivation pinned and deterministic, labels kept apart, seal and open, another owner or id failing, tampering) |
| Indexer client | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/indexer-client test` | 56 passing |
| Envio indexer | `bash packages/indexer/scripts/wsl.sh test` (macOS, Linux, WSL); `... live` (Envio's runtime against a local chain) | config and schema in sync, codegen, typecheck; 54 passing; `live` 10 passing (also five runs in a row) |
| CRE workflows | `pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows test`, `typecheck`, `build` (WASM; needs the CRE CLI: `cre:install`, or `CRE_BIN`) | 212 passing; all three workflows compile to WASM |
| Polaris for Business | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `build` | 279 passing (12 for sealed receipts); the API auth check covers every route |
| The Polaris app | `pnpm --filter @polaris/app test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `check:signatures`, `build` | 47 passing (the Chainlink states, a credit line's provenance, the dollar it signs for, split plans and links, the Android app's `/.well-known/assetlinks.json`, what a build reports to the deploy check, receipt keys beside an unmoved wallet key); 53 signature checks against the Solidity typehashes |
| Halcyon | `pnpm --filter @polaris/shop test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `build` | 96 passing; the build proves it serves only the store's five API routes |
| Landing | `pnpm --filter @polaris/landing typecheck`, `build` | builds |
| Android (TWA) | `pnpm --filter @polaris/android test`, `build` | 51 passing; a signed APK (needs a JDK 17+ and an Android SDK, found on the machine: [`apps/android`](apps/android/README.md#build-it)) |
| The deploy check | `pnpm test:scripts` | 29 passing (every check against a fake deployment, one broken setting at a time) |
| Chainlink FX rates | `pnpm --filter @polaris/fx test`, `typecheck` (`check:live` reads every feed) | 46 passing |
| End to end | `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1 pnpm demo:local` + `pnpm demo:e2e` | 24 of 24 steps (Pay now, Pay in 4 with CRE underwriting, a new buyer's one-tap line, a CRE collection, Subscribe, direct wallet pay, the dashboard, a dashboard payment link paid and reopened); [`docs/demo`](docs/demo) |
| | `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1 pnpm demo:local` + `pnpm demo:e2e:chainlink` | 18 of 18 steps (FX in pesos, CRE underwriting with the line labelled a local run, the guardian pausing and resuming Pay in 4 from Chainlink AUSD/USD on Monad mainnet with Pay now still working, a dunned buyer collected by the log trigger 2 s after signing again, the Chainlink dashboard); [`docs/demo/chainlink`](docs/demo/chainlink/README.md) |
| | `pnpm demo:local` + `pnpm demo:e2e:split` | 22 of 22 steps (a split made on a phone, a share paid by a friend with no account and one with, the same share relayed twice paying once, the organiser's Activity, closing it, a split by named amounts paid in full); [`docs/design/split`](docs/design/split/README.md) |
| | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business e2e:local` | 13 of 13 checks (SDK sessions, relayed Pay now and Pay in 4, verified webhooks, a collection) |
| | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts e2e:local` | all twelve flows (the credit guard and `reauthorize` among them); the buyer, sender and freelancer never hold MON |
| | `pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows e2e:local` | 12 passing (all three workflows and every trigger against real contracts on a local node) |
| Monad testnet | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts check:deployment:monad` | 65 of 65 (every address has code, every role and threshold as recorded; read-only), after the guardian's and the vault's redeploys, with the Privy relayer and registry admin in their roles |
| | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts verify:monad` | 14 of 14 verified on Monadscan, every one an exact match (the 12 in the record and the GuardianReceiver and CollateralVault the redeploys replaced; PolarisCheckout and CollectionsReceiver from the deploy commit, rebuilt from git): [`monad-testnet.verification.json`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.verification.json) |
| | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business smoke:testnet -- --run` | 14 of 14, through the **Privy server wallet**: every buyer and merchant action on Monad testnet, five fresh accounts at 0 MON and nonce 0 before and after ([`docs/demo/testnet`](docs/demo/testnet/README.md)); `smoke:testnet:verify` reads all 19 receipts back |
| | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business privy:prove-policy -- --run` | Privy signed the 3 allowed calls and refused the 7 forbidden ones with `policy_violation` ([output](docs/demo/testnet/privy-prove-policy.txt)) |
| | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business privy:smoke:harness -- --run` | `privy:smoke -- --run`: a $0.50 Pay now relayed by the Privy server wallet, session paid, the buyer at 0 MON ([output](docs/demo/testnet/privy-smoke.txt)) |
| Lockfile | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | passes |
| Docs | `pnpm docs:check`, `pnpm test:scripts` | every link in this README and [`docs/submission`](docs/submission) resolves, every hash in the kit is in the committed evidence; 9 passing |

## Monad testnet deployment

Deployed on 28 Sep 2026 by `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts deploy:monad`
from `0x6Df4a0b84BD608123D1f3412709AcaC69523c115` (34 transactions, 2.94 MON),
from commit `020484b`. The same day `redeploy-guardian:monad` replaced
GuardianReceiver alone with the review's fixes (2 transactions, 0.353 MON):
the receiver now reads the pool itself and trusts the CRE report for the
mainnet price only ([Chainlink CRE](#chainlink-cre-an-orchestration-layer)).
The one it replaced, `0xF825…26D8`, stays on chain with no rounds, and
nothing asks it. Later that day `redeploy-vault:monad` replaced
CollateralVault alone with one that takes `lockWithPermit` (5 transactions,
0.138 MON), so a borrower secures a line with a permit the relayer carries and
never needs MON; the old vault, `0xD0e7…3E72`, no longer raises a limit. Then
the Privy server wallet became the relayer (`grant-relayer:monad`) and a
second Privy server wallet, the registry admin, took MerchantRegistry
(`transfer-registry-owner.mjs`):
[`apps/business/privy-live.md`](apps/business/privy-live.md). The files behind it:

- the record:
  [`packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.json`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.json)
- the script's output:
  [`monad-testnet.deploy.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.deploy.txt)
- every transaction, decoded:
  [`monad-testnet.transactions.json`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.transactions.json)
- the guardian's and the vault's redeploys:
  [`monad-testnet.redeploy-guardian.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.redeploy-guardian.txt),
  [`monad-testnet.redeploy-vault.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.redeploy-vault.txt)
  (and `redeploys` in the record)
- the Privy relayer's roles and the registry's move:
  [`monad-testnet.grant-relayer.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.grant-relayer.txt),
  [`monad-testnet.transfer-registry-owner.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.transfer-registry-owner.txt)
- the read-back after it, 65 of 65 checks:
  [`monad-testnet.check.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.check.txt)
- the source verification, 14 of 14 on Monadscan, each an exact match:
  [`monad-testnet.verification.json`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.verification.json)
  (the run: [`monad-testnet.verify.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.verify.txt))

Chain 10143; explorer [testnet.monadscan.com](https://testnet.monadscan.com).

replaced CollateralVault, [`0xD0e7…3E72`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/address/0xD0e777f8DfA2E62F500054E85F815fC54fae3E72#code), and the replaced GuardianReceiver,

Five webhooks arrived, each verified with polarispay-sdk. The buyer's Pay in
4 line is secured, because an unsecured line needs a CRE underwriting report,
which needs provider keys (the workflow runs, and without keys it returns
`incomplete` rather than guess). The only other sender was the harness (the
deployer minting mock dollars, and submitting the buyer's own signed
`permit(0)` to play a lost approval), labelled as such.

**The earlier run with the dev relayer** (10 of 10, every hash in
[`monad-testnet.smoke.json`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.smoke.json)),
before the Privy relayer existed:

- **Pay now** $25: [`0x5d533afe…`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0x5d533afe3cf9b27adcb7063226baf69925b8834eb7ac32612029212c74e925c2),
  followed by a `payment.succeeded` webhook verified with polarispay-sdk.
- **Pay in 4** $200: [`0x4af42348…`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0x4af4234818aec669b3974c5c44f0f5cbe900858aa6e1e76bb413720374d2522d),
  plan #1, followed by a `plan.opened` webhook.
- A lost approval **signed again**: [`0xf02c45bd…`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0xf02c45bd4ec1102d8ee4a55ea54e9980c28ddff5e7a4dffd222ca0bbba173002),
  which emitted `Reauthorized`.

There the buyer locked its collateral itself (the old vault had no permit
path), so it sent two calls and one approval; every Polaris step was a
signature the dev relayer carried.

The SDK presets (`packages/sdk/src/deployments.ts`), the indexer
(`packages/indexer/config.yaml`, from block 66288120), the CRE staging configs
and the apps' `.env.example` files carry these addresses; tests hold each of
them to the record. The guardian's redeploy moved only GuardianReceiver, which
only the record, PolarisCheckout and the guardian's staging config name; the
vault's moved only CollateralVault (the record, the SDK preset, the indexer).

**PolarisSplit (split the bill) is not on testnet yet.** It came after this
deployment; `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts deploy-split:monad` adds it
in one transaction without moving anything (it has no owner, no roles and
holds nothing) and records it, and `check:deployment:monad` then reads it
back. Until then the API reports no split contract and the app says split
the bill isn't available there; it runs end to end on the local chain.

PolarisCheckout on testnet is the deploy commit's: the review's two
`reauthorize` fixes are in the code and its tests, not on chain (a redeploy
would move every address the apps, the indexer and the workflows use, and
the deployer's MON went to the guardian first). `verify:monad` verifies the
deployed one from the deploy commit's sources, rebuilt from git and checked
against the chain: Monadscan shows the code that runs, not today's.

### Monad (Track 02: consumer products and payments)

| Requirement | Where | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| A consumer payments product on Monad | Pay by link, Pay now, Pay in 4, subscriptions, send by link, payouts: `packages/contracts/contracts/PolarisCheckout.sol`, `PolarisSend.sol`, `apps/app`, `apps/business` | `pnpm demo:local`, `docs/demo` |
| Track 02's third example idea: split the bill | `PolarisSplit`: the organiser signs `CreateSplit` (equal or named shares); each friend pays exactly their share with one ERC-3009 `ReceiveWithAuthorization` whose nonce is the split and the share, forwarded to the organiser in the same call (no custody); `closeSplit` cancels the rest. The app's create, link, pay and organiser screens; `GET /api/public/splits/{id}` | `pnpm demo:e2e:split` (22 of 22, [`docs/design/split`](docs/design/split/README.md)); `PolarisSplit.test.js`. Local chain only: not on testnet until `deploy-split:monad` runs |
| Gasless for the user | Every buyer action is an EIP-712 / ERC-3009 signature relayed by `apps/business` `POST /api/relay`; the buyer holds no MON | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts e2e:local` (buyer, sender and freelancer end with 0 MON) |
| Contract addresses on a Monad network | Monad testnet, 28 Sep 2026: [every address and transaction](#monad-testnet-deployment) (`deploy:monad` refuses mainnet), every source verified on Monadscan ([14 of 14](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.verification.json), exact matches) | `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts check:deployment:monad` (65 of 65); `pnpm --filter @polaris/business smoke:testnet -- --run` (14 of 14, through the Privy relayer) |

### Agora: AUSD cross-border payments

| Requirement | Where | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Users send AUSD across borders | `PolarisSend` escrows AUSD by ERC-3009 against a link key; the app's Send and Claim (`apps/app/src/sheets/send.tsx`, `claim.tsx`); AUSD's own EIP-712 domain (`Agora Dollar`, `1`) | contracts `e2e:local` steps 8-9; `apps/app` `check:signatures` |
| Real balances and activity | `apps/app/src/lib/data/live.ts`: `AUSD.balanceOf`, the API's record of chain events; the offline demo is labelled on every screen and never links a made-up hash | `docs/demo/01-app-home-funded.png`, `30-app-home-after.png` |
| Local currency | Shown next to dollars at the live **Chainlink** rate, with its age ("≈ ARS 161.241 · Chainlink rate, 3 min ago · indicative"): `packages/fx` reads Chainlink Data Feeds server-side (EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF, CAD from Monad mainnet; 18 more from Ethereum, Polygon, Base), served by the app's `/api/fx`; no line for the 10 currencies without a feed, or when the rate is older than its own feed allows (twice its heartbeat, or heartbeat plus 10 min: 14 min for Monad's feeds, 26 h at most), in which case the next feed is read | `pnpm --filter @polaris/fx test`; `pnpm --filter @polaris/fx check:live`; `docs/design/fx/` |
| A mobile app | An installable PWA, and an **Android app**: a Trusted Web Activity around it ([`apps/android`](apps/android/README.md), package `app.polarispay.twa`), in which Face ID is Chrome's own passkey ceremony, so the same account works in both; the site vouches for it with `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` | `pnpm --filter @polaris/android build` (a signed APK; [the build of 28 Sep 2026](apps/android/README.md#the-build-of-28-sep-2026)); `adb install -r apps/android/dist/polaris-1.0.0-debug.apk` |

### Mera: the entire account layer

| Requirement | Where | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Passkey accounts, no seed phrase, no extension, no custody | `apps/app/src/lib/account/mera.ts` (`createPasskeyWithPrfOutput`, `createSecp256k1SigningSession`), key derived in the browser and zeroed (`derive.ts`); the relayer never holds user funds | `apps/app/README.md` "Accounts" |
| Nothing else stands in for it | The dev signer only exists in `next dev` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SIGNER=1` (a production build blanks the flag, `apps/app/next.config.ts`) and refuses the production domain. The app also offers **Continue with email** (a Privy embedded wallet) beneath Face ID | ask Mera whether the email option is acceptable, or drop it |
| One Passkey, Many Keys: a non-wallet use of the PRF key material | **Receipts only you can read.** The Face ID that derives the wallet key also derives, by HKDF labels of their own, an AES-256-GCM key and an X25519 inbox key pair, in the same ceremony (no extra prompt). The account registers the inbox key with its own signature; Polaris for Business seals what was bought (description, line items, order, the plan's schedule) to it with RFC 9180 HPKE when the payment settles, and drops the plaintext; the app opens it on Activity with the session's keys. AAD binds each ciphertext to its owner and id. [`packages/receipts`](packages/receipts/README.md), [`apps/app` README](apps/app/README.md#receipts-only-you-can-read), `apps/business/src/server/receipts.ts` | `pnpm --filter @polaris/receipts test`; `apps/business` `test/receipts.test.ts`; `apps/app` `test/receipts.test.ts`. Not yet opened with a real Face ID on a phone (the app isn't hosted) |

### Privy: beyond authentication

| Requirement | Where | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Embedded wallets doing real work | The merchant's embedded wallet signs its `MerchantRegistry` registration right after the business is named (`useRegisterMerchant`, `apps/business/src/app/(privy)/login/login-view.tsx`, `components/dashboard/registration.tsx`) and its withdrawals (`useWithdraw`) | `docs/demo/44-dashboard-settings-registered.png` (the same API, signed by the local session's wallet) |
| Policy-controlled server wallets | The relayer is a Privy server wallet (`src/server/relayer/signer.ts`) held to a policy (`src/server/policy/relayer.ts`: deny MON, allow each Polaris function, $0.10 floor); automatic payouts via `addSigners` with a per-merchant policy (`src/server/policy/payout.ts`) | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business test` (policy tests); `privy:prove-policy -- --run` ([output](docs/demo/testnet/privy-prove-policy.txt)) and `privy:smoke -- --run` ([output](docs/demo/testnet/privy-smoke.txt)) |
| Shown live | **Done on Monad testnet** (28 Sep 2026): the relayer and the registry admin are Privy server wallets under their policies; Privy refused the 7 forbidden calls; `smoke:testnet` ran 14 of 14 through them ([`apps/business/privy-live.md`](apps/business/privy-live.md)). `pnpm demo:local` still uses the dev adapter with Privy off | [`docs/demo/testnet`](docs/demo/testnet/README.md) |

### Chainlink CRE: an orchestration layer

Three CRE workflows (`@chainlink/cre-sdk` 1.22.0, CLI v1.35.0) run Polaris's
credit. Between them they use all three trigger types (HTTP, cron and EVM
log). Each run that has work to do ends in a signed report that Chainlink's
forwarder delivers to a Polaris receiver on Monad (an idle, thin or unchanged
run writes nothing), and every report changes what the product does next:
whether a buyer gets a line, whether an instalment is collected, and whether
a new Pay in 4 plan can open. The full reference is
[`workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md).

| Workflow | What it orchestrates | Trigger | CRE capabilities used | Code | Receiver on Monad testnet |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `polaris-underwrite` | A buyer's credit line. The API fires it when the buyer taps **Raise your limit**. It checks the buyer's consent and history-wallet proof, gathers wallet facts (Nansen, Zerion, Etherscan, public RPCs), and refuses thin files. It attests the facts, and `ScoreManager` scores them on chain. Unsecured lines open only from these reports (`requireUnderwriting`). | **HTTP** | HTTP trigger; HTTP client with consensus; **Confidential HTTP** (a switch; implemented and unit-tested, not yet run against the real capability); EVM read (`profileOf`, `linkedUserOf`, `balanceOf`); signed report → EVM write | `workflows/src/underwriting/`, `workflows/underwriting/main.ts` | `UnderwritingReceiver` [`0x523e…4a19`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/address/0x523e9791d0e324525F66F91b21B478C18e284a19) |
| `polaris-collections` | Every due Pay in 4 instalment and subscription renewal, plus liquidation past grace. It finds candidates (Envio, or the chain), checks each with `checkTasks`, and backs off along the dunning ladder. Failures are reported to the API through a signed callback. On testnet as committed: candidates from the chain, callback off (`evidence --callback <url>` turns it on for a run). | **Cron** (every minute in staging, daily in production) | Cron trigger; EVM read; HTTP (Envio and the callback, when configured); signed report → EVM write | `workflows/src/collections/workflow.ts`, `tasks.ts`, `backoff.ts` | `CollectionsReceiver` [`0x4201…45CC`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/address/0x4201C0837f3bB4e0E1A982C5666BF00b5EE145CC) |
| `polaris-collections` (instant retry) | A buyer whose approval was lost signs once (`PolarisCheckout.reauthorize`, relayed). The `Reauthorized` log starts a run that collects what that buyer owes (`dueTasksFor`) in the next block, without waiting for the 6-hour rung. | **EVM log** on `PolarisCheckout.Reauthorized` (finalized) | Log trigger; EVM read; signed report → EVM write | `workflows/src/collections/retry.ts`, `PolarisCheckout.reauthorize` | the same `CollectionsReceiver` |
| `polaris-guardian` | The risk guard. It brings **Chainlink AUSD/USD from Monad mainnet** to the pool on Monad testnet, in one run. Its verdict is a depeg (outside $0.995 to $1.005), low free cash (< $1,000), bad debt (> 5%, once $10,000 is lent) or a stale price (> 2 h). `GuardianReceiver` checks the verdict against the thresholds and trusts the DON for the mainnet price only: it reads the pool's cash and bad debt itself on every call, and refuses a report whose pool is not the chain's. `PolarisCheckout.openPlan` refuses new Pay in 4 plans while it says paused; Pay now, Send and Subscribe never ask. A stale price fails open; the pool's checks never do. | **Cron** (every minute in staging, every 10 min in production) | Cron trigger; EVM reads on **two chains** (mainnet feed, testnet pool at one finalized block); signed report → EVM write | `workflows/src/guardian/`, `workflows/guardian/main.ts` | `GuardianReceiver` [`0x4c99…e3Df`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/address/0x4c99136634F670cd59E73fc284fED164C662e3Df) |

Two related pieces use Chainlink but are not CRE workflows:

- **The pool health feed.** `GuardianReceiver` is also an
  `AggregatorV3Interface`. It is labelled "Polaris pool health, computed by
  CRE". It is not a Chainlink feed and not Proof of Reserve.
- **Local currency.** `packages/fx` reads Chainlink FX Data Feeds server-side
  (it does not use CRE); see the Agora table above.

#### On Monad testnet (chain 10143)

The receivers are deployed and wired, and the smoke test drove real
transactions through the checkout that asks them (see
[Monad testnet deployment](#monad-testnet-deployment)); the CRE reports that
reached them are [below](#cre-runs-on-monad-testnet-28-sep-2026). `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts check:deployment:monad`
reads all of it back (65 of 65, read again on 1 Oct 2026 after the redeploys and the move to Privy:
[`monad-testnet.check.txt`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.check.txt)).

#### CRE runs on Monad testnet (28 Sep 2026)

Each row is one `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` run with the CRE CLI
v1.35.0, logged in as the team's CRE organisation (deploy access is not
enabled yet, so these are simulations, which the bounty accepts). For each
run, the CLI compiled the workflow to WASM, ran it, and sent its signed report
to Monad testnet through Chainlink's forwarder for `monad-testnet`,
`0xB9F79d863261869B234c481D1f9A7af84AeAd192`. `cre workflow supported-chains`
lists that forwarder
([`supported-chains.txt`](workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/supported-chains.txt)).
Every transaction was read back from Monad testnet with status 1, and
"Delivered" is the forwarder's `ReportProcessed` result for the receiver.

| Workflow and trigger | What it orchestrated | Monad testnet transaction | Block | Delivered |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `polaris-collections`, **EVM log trigger** on `PolarisCheckout.Reauthorized` | A buyer re-signed ([`0xf02c45bd…`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0xf02c45bd4ec1102d8ee4a55ea54e9980c28ddff5e7a4dffd222ca0bbba173002)). The workflow read what the buyer owed, signed a report, and `CollectionsReceiver` collected instalment #1 | [`0x1116fbb4…292c4d`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0x1116fbb4b53263776da4c5cc6d7984b66f1d31ac81f35215b5dcf246f1292c4d) | 66359311 | `result=true` |
| `polaris-collections`, **cron trigger** | Found due and overdue plans on chain: collected one instalment and liquidated a plan past its grace period | [`0xd7bcf41e…1a97e4`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0xd7bcf41e8efa7841c86870689a3c9599c3a960d39f4c28b82c6980dc1f1a97e4) | 66359350 | `result=true` |
| `polaris-guardian`, **cron trigger** | Read **Chainlink AUSD/USD on Monad mainnet** (`0xE20751C7B5867bCBef815ffc1b284c3f412a9e13`: 0.99982194), read the pool on testnet, and attested "healthy, Pay in 4 open" as `GuardianReceiver` round 1 | [`0x015bd95d…3f9080`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0x015bd95da145efb4884ea0e50730728a2023a15f890f737847ede4064e3f9080) | 66359401 | `result=true` |
| `polaris-underwrite`, **HTTP trigger** | Ran and correctly wrote nothing. With no provider keys, Zerion and Etherscan answered "unauthorized", so it could not confirm the account's first-seen date and sent count, and returned `incomplete` instead of guessing | none (by design) | | |

The logs of all six runs, the table and `runs.json` are in
[`workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/`](workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/). The first
two underwriting runs stopped before running. They exposed two bugs that the
real CLI and runtime catch and the unit tests could not, both now fixed and
tested:
- The evidence script passed a 100-character `--config` path; the CLI's
  limit is 97 (`cliConfigArg`).
- zod's `.url()` needs the `URL` constructor, which the CRE WASM runtime does
  not have, so every URL in a config failed validation (`httpUrl`).

An underwriting report (and the first live Confidential HTTP call) needs a
free Etherscan API key and a consenting history wallet (see
[What only you can do](#what-only-you-can-do)). To run everything again from
this checkout: `pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows evidence`, adding
`--retry-tx <a Reauthorized transaction>` for the log trigger.

#### The guardian's feed-shaped view

`GuardianReceiver` serves the guardian's verdict as a feed any contract can
read, labelled `description() = "Polaris pool health, computed by CRE"`
(8 decimals, `version() = 1`):

- `latestRoundData()` returns one round per attestation. `answer` is the
  pool's free cash when the report landed (read from the pool, not from the
  report) in dollars at the attested AUSD/USD price, and 0 while paused.
  `startedAt` and `updatedAt` are when the workflow observed it.
  Before the first attestation it returns all zeros, like a new Chainlink
  aggregator.
- `getRoundData(id)` reads past rounds. `isCreditPaused()`, `creditStatus()`
  and `latestAttestation()` give the verdict and its reasons (depeg 1, low
  cash 2, bad debt 4, stale price 8, owner pause 128), `creditStatus()` with
  the pool's reasons and the price's apart. `currentInputs()` is the
  workflow's own read of the pool, the thresholds and the acknowledged bad
  debt.
- On Monad testnet before the first CRE run (28 Sep 2026): `latestRound() = 0`, so the price
  fails open, and the pool, read live, passes: free cash $9,800, owed
  $200.000152, no bad debt, $200 lent (under the $10,000 floor). So
  `creditPaused() = (false, 0)`. Thresholds $0.995 to $1.005 / $1,000 /
  500 bps from $10,000 lent / 7,200 s.

#### Confidential HTTP: what it buys and what it costs

**Status: implemented and unit-tested; not yet exercised against the real
capability.** Every call so far ran on the SDK's test runtime with its mocks
and the underwriting package's synthesized fixtures. The first real one is a
CLI run with a provider key (a free Etherscan key is enough): `evidence --only
underwriting` keeps its log.

With `confidentialHttp: true` (staging and local), the paid provider calls
(Nansen, Zerion, Etherscan) go through CRE's Confidential HTTP. The
workflow sends `{{.NANSEN_API_KEY}}`-style placeholders, and the enclave
fills them from the Vault DON, so no node ever holds a provider key. Each
provider is also called once instead of once per node, which Nansen's
10 free credits a day can afford. **The trade-off:** the DON trusts one
enclave's answer. With the switch off, every node calls the provider and the
report carries the median, so one bad response is outvoted. With it on, the
facts are only as good as the one response the enclave got. Production keeps
it off until a deployed run shows Monad's DON serves the capability. Public
RPC calls always stay on the plain HTTP client. Details, including Zerion's
Basic header and Etherscan's POST body:
[`workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md#confidential-http).

#### Simulated versus deployed, exactly

| | Status |
|---|---|
| The Polaris contracts, including the three CRE receivers | **Deployed on Monad testnet** (28 Sep 2026), every role read back on chain; GuardianReceiver redeployed the same day with the review's fixes. PolarisCheckout's `reauthorize` fixes are in code only (not redeployed) |
| The three workflows | **Built** (WASM, CLI v1.35.0) and **tested**: 209 unit tests on the SDK's test runtime, and `e2e:local` 12 of 12 against real contracts on a local node. **Run by the CLI on Monad testnet** (`simulate --broadcast`, 28 Sep 2026): collections on both triggers and the guardian delivered reports; underwriting ran and returned `incomplete` without provider keys ([the runs](#cre-runs-on-monad-testnet-28-sep-2026)). **Not deployed to a DON**: that needs deploy access (`cre account access`) |
| Where a simulated run's report goes | A real Monad testnet transaction: the CLI signs with the transmitter key and calls Chainlink's `MockKeystoneForwarder`. It carries no DON signatures, so each receiver accepts it only from that transmitter (`tx.origin`) |
| After a DON deploy | `deploy:monad` with `CRE_FORWARDER=production`, or the owner moves the receivers to the production forwarder. Then `lock-receivers:monad` pins the workflow owner, names and ids and clears the simulation transmitter; it refuses Chainlink's MockKeystoneForwarder (or anything that is not Chainlink's KeystoneForwarder) as the production one. Not done: there is no deployment to lock to |
| "Verified by Chainlink CRE" on a credit line | Only for a report delivered through Chainlink's KeystoneForwarder (DON-signed). A simulated run's report reads "Chainlink CRE (simulated)", a local one "CRE workflow, local run" (`apps/business` `src/server/cre/provenance.ts`) |
| AUSD/USD | **Real**: Chainlink's feed on Monad mainnet, read only; nothing writes to mainnet |
| The dollar on testnet | **Mock**: `MockAUSD` ("Mock AUSD"), because the deployer held no testnet AUSD for the pool (decision 24) |
| The relayer on testnet | **A Privy server wallet** under its policy (`RELAYER_MODE=privy`), since 28 Sep 2026; the earlier dev adapter key is kept in `roles.previousRelayers` |
| The demo's pause | The owner raises the depeg threshold above the real price ("threshold raised for demo"). The price is never faked |

**End to end on a local chain, headless** (`DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1 pnpm demo:local`,
then `pnpm demo:e2e:chainlink`; [`docs/demo/chainlink`](docs/demo/chainlink/README.md)):
**18 of 18 steps passed** (28 Sep 2026, after the review's fixes).

- An Argentine buyer sees the Send amount in pesos at Chainlink's USD / ARS
  rate.
- Raise your limit runs `polaris-underwrite` and opens a $1,000 line on chain.
  The credit screen names the report "CRE workflow, local run" (a local
  forwarder, no DON signature), never "Verified by Chainlink CRE". Pay in 4
  then opens a plan.
- The owner raises the depeg threshold to $1.001 (**threshold raised for
  demo**, captioned on every paused screen). GuardianReceiver judges the last
  attested Chainlink price by it at once, and the guardian's next scheduled
  run reads Chainlink AUSD/USD 0.99978429 on Monad mainnet and attests the
  pause on chain (`creditPaused() = (true, 1)`). The shop, the checkout and
  the dashboard say so, and Pay now still goes through. Once the threshold is
  restored, Pay in 4 resumes, and the next run attests it.
- A buyer who revoked their approval is dunned by the collections cron and
  signs once. The `Reauthorized` log trigger collects the payment **2 s
  later**.

Those runs are each workflow's real handler (the code `cre workflow build`
compiles) on the CRE SDK's test runtime: `trigger:local`,

| Beyond raw data | The buyer sees their line and the plain-language reasons behind it, explained by `@polarispay/underwriting` from the facts in the forwarder transaction (`apps/business/src/server/credit/explain.ts`), in the checkout, the credit screen and the dashboard's "Why your buyers got credit" | `docs/demo/20-payin4-6-limit-raised.png`, `41-dashboard-panels.png` |
| Live Nansen calls | *Not yet*: the fixtures are synthesized (and labelled); the local trigger reads them | [What only you can do](#what-only-you-can-do), step 3 |

### Envio: HyperIndex behind a core feature

| Requirement | Where | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| An indexer of the product's events | `packages/indexer` (HyperIndex 3.12, 26 entities, a webhook outbox that emits exactly `polarispay-sdk`'s events) | `bash packages/indexer/scripts/wsl.sh test` and `live` (macOS, Linux, WSL, CI); `pnpm indexer:local` serves its GraphQL for a local chain (Postgres and Hasura in Docker) |
| Consumed by the product | The dashboard's "Indexed by Envio" feed reads it through `@polarispay/indexer-client` when `POLARIS_INDEXER_URL` is set (`apps/business/src/server/insights.ts`); the CRE collections workflow's candidate list is the client's `DUE_CANDIDATES` query; the chain sync can read logs from Envio's HyperRPC (`POLARIS_LOGS_RPC_URL`) | `pnpm --filter @polaris/business test` (`test/insights.test.ts`); without an indexer the feed shows the server's own chain sync with a "Chain sync" pill (`docs/demo/41-dashboard-panels.png`). On a local chain (6 Oct, [what ran](packages/indexer/README.md#what-ran-on-6-oct-macos-docker-desktop)): the dashboard's code path (`test/insights.live.test.ts`), the outbox read by cursor into events the SDK validates, and the real `polaris-collections` cron taking its candidates from `DueCandidates` and collecting a due instalment, all against the live endpoint |
| Deployed | *Not yet* | [What only you can do](#what-only-you-can-do), step 5 |

### What is simulated or sample

- **Everything on-chain in `docs/demo` is a local Hardhat chain**, deployed by
  the same script as testnet. Receipts there link nowhere (no explorer).
- **On Monad testnet** the contracts are real and the relayer is the Privy
  server wallet, but the dollar is `MockAUSD` (a labelled mock anyone can
  mint). The smoke test's Pay in 4 line is secured by collateral, because no
  CRE underwriting report has run there yet.
- **The dev signer** stands in for Face ID in the demo (a key kept in the
  browser; badge on every screen). Its receipt keys come from a stand-in PRF
  output derived from that key, so sealed receipts open in the demo exactly
  as they would after a Face ID; with a real passkey they are untested.
- **The CRE runs** in the demo are the real workflow handlers on the SDK's test
  runtime (`trigger:local`, `collections:local`, `guardian:local`), not a DON
  or the CRE CLI; the guardian's AUSD/USD is Chainlink's real Monad mainnet
  feed, and its demo pause is the owner raising the threshold above that
  price ("threshold raised for demo"), never a faked price. The underwriting
  run's evidence is the
  underwriting package's synthesized fixtures ("fresh-account" for the buyer,
  "strong" for the history wallet), and on chain 31337 with no wallet in the
  browser a stand-in key signs the history wallet's proof (the app says so).
  The credit line there names its report "CRE workflow, local run": only a
  DON-signed report is ever called "Verified by Chainlink CRE".
- **The dashboard's local session** is `pnpm demo:local`'s own; the server
  accepts it only in development, on a local chain, with Privy off.
- **Local-currency rates** are live Chainlink rates read from public RPCs and
  labelled "indicative"; only EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF and CAD come from Monad (the
  rest from Ethereum, Polygon or Base), and 10 currencies have no feed and no line.
- **Split the bill** has only run on the local chain: PolarisSplit is not on
  Monad testnet yet (`deploy-split:monad`, not run).
- The app's offline demo (no API configured) shows sample data and says so.

## What only you can do

1. **Monad testnet:** done on 28 Sep 2026 ([the deployment](#monad-testnet-deployment)),
   and GuardianReceiver redeployed the same day with the review's fixes. What
   is left (source verification on Monadscan is done: 14 of 14, exact
   matches, [`monad-testnet.verification.json`](packages/contracts/deployments/monad-testnet.verification.json);
   after any redeploy, run `verify:monad` again):
   - Real AUSD: if Agora sends testnet AUSD, a redeploy with `AUSD_MODE=ausd`
     (or `fund-pool:monad` on a real-AUSD deployment) replaces the mock dollar.
   - **PolarisSplit** (split the bill): `pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts deploy-split:monad`
     (one transaction, about 1.9M gas; nothing else moves), then restart
     Polaris for Business, `privy:setup-relayer -- --apply` (to add it to
     the Privy relayer's policy), and `check:deployment:monad`.
   - Optional: a PolarisCheckout redeploy for the two `reauthorize` fixes
     (it moves every address the apps, the indexer and the workflows use, so
     after the freeze). The deployer has about 0.30 MON left.
2. **Chainlink CRE:** logged in, and the evidence run is done: three CRE
   reports delivered on Monad testnet on 28 Sep 2026
   ([the runs](#cre-runs-on-monad-testnet-28-sep-2026)). Still open: request
   deploy access with `cre account access` (the CLI says it is not enabled).
   Optional:
   - `--callback http://localhost:3100/api/cre/callback` with a running API
     and `POLARIS_CALLBACK_SECRET` in `workflows/.env` equal to the API's
     `POLARIS_CRE_CALLBACK_SECRET`, so collections' HTTP callback shows in its
     log.
   - An **underwriting report** (not `incomplete` or `thin`) needs a free
     Etherscan API key (Zerion's too if possible) in `workflows/.env` and
     `POLARIS_UNDERWRITE_WALLET_KEY` set to a consenting wallet with at least
     90 days and 10 transactions on Ethereum or Base; then
     `evidence --only underwriting`. Its log is also the first real
     Confidential HTTP call.
   - For the demo recording: `collections:loop --broadcast`,
     `guardian:loop --broadcast`, `retry:listen --broadcast`, and point
     `CRE_UNDERWRITING_TRIGGER_URL` at the CLI's trigger.
3. **Nansen, Zerion, Etherscan:** create API keys (ask Nansen for credits) and
   run `pnpm --filter @polarispay/underwriting record --linked <a consenting wallet>`
   to replace the synthesized fixtures.
4. **Privy:** the server wallets, their policies, the relayer's roles and the
   registry's move are done on Monad testnet
   ([`apps/business/privy-live.md`](apps/business/privy-live.md)). Left, in
   the Privy dashboard: turn on email and Google login, add the hosted
   origins as allowed domains, and move the admin key quorum's key
   (`apps/business/.privy-admin.key`) into a password manager and delete the
   file.
5. **Envio:** log in to Envio Cloud, install its GitHub app, deploy
   `packages/indexer` (see its README), and set `POLARIS_INDEXER_URL` on the
   API and `candidates.indexerUrl` in the CRE configs.
6. **Hosting:** follow [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md): the app, the
   landing and the shop on Vercel (the shop with Upstash Redis), Polaris for
   Business on Fly.io from its Dockerfile, one Machine with a volume (or
   Railway), with `POLARIS_CHECKOUT_ORIGIN`, `POLARIS_PUBLIC_URL`,
   `POLARIS_KEY_PEPPER`, `CRON_SECRET`, `POLARIS_TRUSTED_PROXIES` and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SHOP_URL`; add both origins to Privy's allowed domains;
   then run `node scripts/deploy-check.mjs` with the four URLs. Never set
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SIGNER` for a deployed app: `next build` blanks it (and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SIGNER_PERSIST`) unless `POLARIS_ALLOW_DEV_SIGNER_BUILD=1`,
   so a hosted build only offers Face ID (Mera) and email (Privy).
7. **Ask the sponsors:** Agora, whether a PWA counts as a mobile app (the
   Android app is built either way); Mera, whether the app's email option
   (Privy) beside Face ID is acceptable.
8. **The Android app on a phone:** `pnpm --filter @polaris/android build`,
   then `adb install -r apps/android/dist/polaris-1.0.0-debug.apk` (USB
   debugging on). Once the app is hosted, set
   `POLARIS_ANDROID_SHA256_FINGERPRINTS` on it to what
   `pnpm --filter @polaris/android fingerprint` prints, so Chrome drops the
   address bar, and try Face ID in it (PRF inside a TWA is still unverified on
   a real device). For Google Play: a Play Console account, an upload key and
   `build -- --bundle` ([Publishing](apps/android/README.md#publishing-later)).

## What's next

- **One owner key is a single point of failure.** Every receiver, the
  checkout and the loan engine are owned by the deployer EOA. With it one
  could point a receiver at another forwarder or transmitter and forge
  credit facts, or force the guard open or closed. Fine for a testnet
  hackathon build; after the freeze, ownership moves to a multisig, with a
  timelock on `setForwarderAddress`, `setSimulationTransmitter`,
  `setOverride` and `setThresholds`.
- **The CRE workflows on a DON**, once deploy access comes through: deploy
  all three, `lock-receivers:monad` to the production KeystoneForwarder, and
  the credit line's provenance reads "Verified by Chainlink CRE".
- **PolarisCheckout with the `reauthorize` fixes**, redeployed with the
  addresses the apps, the indexer and the workflows use.
- **Real AUSD** on testnet, then mainnet credit after an audit.
- **CCIP** to take Pay in 4 repayments in AUSD from another chain.
- **Split the bill on testnet** (`deploy-split:monad`), and then in the
  Envio indexer (its events are in the API's chain sync today).

## Screenshots

### Pay in 4, end to end

Captured from a `pnpm demo:e2e` run against `pnpm demo:local`. A buyer at the
Halcyon demo shop picks Pay in 4, and the Polaris checkout opens in a pop-up.
The CRE underwriting workflow raises their limit with plain-language reasons,
and they confirm. The shop gets a paid order with four payments, and the
merchant sees the sale and the plan. Locally, a dev signer stands in for Face
ID; the badge says so.

### The Polaris app on the web (customers)

On a laptop the customer app has its own layout in the same design system as
the merchant web app: the reference, the merchant web and the customer web,
side by side.

### Split the bill

One link, four friends, each share straight to whoever paid: on a phone the
organiser's split and a friend paying theirs; on the desktop a friend with
no account yet, and the organiser's split in Activity. Every capture is in
[`docs/design/split`](docs/design/split/README.md), from `pnpm demo:e2e:split`.

## Pre-existing components

The Metropolis rules allow pre-existing code as a foundation if it is
identified. Everything below was written before the build window (1 Sep 2026).
It was imported **byte-for-byte** in the first commit of this repository
(`85b29e4`), from
[`nickthelegend/polaris-solana@daca8ca`](https://github.com/nickthelegend/polaris-solana/tree/daca8ca)
(30 Aug 2026). Every git blob ID in that commit matches the source.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/contracts/contracts/*.sol` (as of `85b29e4`) | `PolarisLoanEngine`, `PolarisPayments`, `ScoreManager`, `CollateralVault`, `MerchantRegistry`, `BatchSettlement`, `MockUSDC` |
| `packages/contracts/test/*` (as of `85b29e4`) | The Hardhat suite for those contracts, including exploit regressions |
| `packages/contracts/scripts/*`, `deployments/*` | Sepolia deployment and end-to-end scripts, and their recorded runs |
| `packages/underwriting` | Underwriting signals and collectors |
| `packages/sdk` | `polarispay-sdk` 0.2.x |
| `packages/keeperhub/src/dunning.ts`, `errors.ts` | The dunning ladder and the failure kinds it branches on |
| `packages/db/src/webhooks.ts` | Webhook signing and verification |
| `apps/gateway/src/score.ts` | Plain-language score explanations |

**Everything after `85b29e4` is new work for Metropolis.** To see it:

```bash
git diff --stat 85b29e4..HEAD
```

The earlier product (a Solana program, Android apps and a merchant platform)
stays in `polaris-solana` as prior work. None of it is part of this submission
unless listed above.

## AI coding tools

As the Metropolis rules require, we disclose that this project is built with
the help of AI coding tools. We use **Claude Code** (Anthropic) for
implementation, tests and review. Commits it co-authored carry a
`Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.

The photographs, portraits, the 3D coin and the abstract light streaks in
`apps/landing/public/assets` and `apps/app/public/assets` are AI-generated with
ChatGPT's image generation. The looping background video, where present, is
generated with Gemini. They depict no real people. The Polaris mark and wordmark
in `packages/brand` are the team's own artwork.
