 * Time series for the desktop charts (ref E's line and candles), rebuilt from

 * payment; drawn as one smooth continuous curve, each step eases in over a
 * short while before it lands (a visible wiggle per payment, never a long
 * ramp), so the line always ends exactly on today's figure.
 *
 * Nothing is drawn before the account (or the line) existed: a series
 * starts at `since` when that is inside the frame. And a figure is only
 * given a history the moves explain: when the steps since `since` don't add
 * up to today's figure (a move the app can't see), the line starts at the
 * first move it knows and the series says so (`explained: false`), so no
 * screen shows a percentage or a flat week it made up.
