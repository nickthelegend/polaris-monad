/**
 * The workflows' configs for a local chain (`pnpm demo:local`), built in
 * memory from the committed staging templates and the chain's deployment
 * record, the way `configure local` builds config.local.json, with what a
 * local runner needs on top:
 *
 * - the forwarder the deployment's receivers trust (demo:local deploys its
 *   own MockKeystoneForwarder; chain:local plants one at the Monad testnet
 *   simulation forwarder's address);
 * - the dunning ladder's window set from the runner's interval, so every
 *   rung gets an attempt even when a run starts a few seconds late (a missed
 *   first rung would leave a failed instalment for the 6 h rung);
 * - the guardian's price: Chainlink's AUSD/USD Data Feed on Monad mainnet,
 *   read over its public RPC (what staging and production read), or the
 *   local chain's labelled MockAusdUsdFeed when offline.
 *
 * Pure: the runners pass in the files they read, and the tests call it
 * directly. Nothing here is written to the workflows' folders, so a
 * config.local.json left by `chain:local` never leaks into a demo run.
