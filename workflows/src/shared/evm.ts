/**
 * EVM plumbing every workflow here uses: reads (at the last finalized block,
 * or at one block by number), the gas limit, the write, and the receipt the
 * write left behind.
 *
 * Two CRE facts shape this file (docs/research/cre.md):
 *   - Monad bills the gas *limit*. So a report's limit is sized from an
 *     estimate of the signed report itself, plus 15%, clamped (plan §5.3).
 *     Never the 10M cap. An estimate of the whole delivery is first lifted
 *     past the forwarder's catch (`deliveryGas`), measured on Monad testnet.
 *   - Under `cre workflow simulate`, a receiver that reverts still reads as
 *     success (§6.4): the mock forwarder swallows the revert. So after every
 *     write the receipt is read back and the forwarder's own
 *     `ReportProcessed(..., result)` decides, not the write status alone.
