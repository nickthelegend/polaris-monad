# Zero-mock test plan

Every page, endpoint, on-chain interaction and integration of Polaris, with
what "correct" means for each. Run through a real browser (Claude in Chrome)
against the real local stack: an anvil fork of Monad testnet with Agora's
AUSD, real contracts, real signed transactions, the real SQLite store, the
real APIs. On every item the console has no errors and the network tab has
no failed request the product didn't expect. Status is one of **PASS**,
**FAIL** (with the fix), or **UNTESTED** (with the exact missing
dependency); never PASS on an assumption. See [`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) P4.

**Stack under test.** `demo:local` in fork mode on its own ports (PLAN P2.1).
Buyers sign in with a real WebAuthn ceremony: Claude in Chrome uses the
person's own platform authenticator (Touch ID) when they are present; the
automated run (`demo:e2e`) uses Chrome's virtual authenticator with PRF, so
Mera's own code derives every key. Monad testnet itself is on hold: items
that need it are UNTESTED, "awaiting testnet go".

Legend for the run columns: **R1** first full run, **R2** the re-run after
fixes.

## F. The Polaris app: flows

| ID | Flow | Correct means | R1 | R2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Face ID sign-up | One ceremony; Mera derives the account; reload and storage clear → same account from the passkey | not run | |
| F2 | Pay now from a link | One confirm; relayed `PolarisCheckout.pay` on the fork; buyer −amount, merchant +amount −0.5%; receipt shown; buyer holds 0 MON | PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator): 6 Oct, the fork: one Face ID confirm in the shop's popup, receipt shown; on chain the buyer −$349.00, the merchant +$347.26 (−0.5%, $1.75 fee) in the same transaction, the buyer at 0 MON | |
| F3 | Pay in 4 | Plan opens on chain against the credit line; merchant paid in full from the pool; 4 × instalments shown | PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator): 6 Oct, the fork, against a line from Boost (no provider keys, so the review opens none): the checkout shows 4 instalments; `LoanCreated` for the buyer, $349.00 owed against the $351 line, `activeDebtOf` +$349.00; PolarisLoanEngine paid the merchant the full $349.00 in the same transaction; receipt, popup closed, the shop's order paid by webhook; the plan on the dashboard, sealed for the buyer | |
| F4 | Raise your limit | With no Nansen/Zerion key: says which provider isn't configured; never a line from invented data | PASS (6 Oct, `demo:e2e` on the fork: names Zerion, Etherscan and Nansen as not set up; on-chain limit stays $0) | |
| F5 | Subscribe | First period charged on chain; cancel stops the next | Partly. First period: PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator) (6 Oct, the fork: the Coffee Club in the popup, the order paid by webhook from the chain sync). Cancel: not run (no step in `demo:e2e`) | |
| F6 | Send by link → claim | Escrowed in PolarisSend; claim pays the recipient once; sender cancel works before claim | not run (`demo:e2e` has no send-by-link step) | |
| F7 | Split the bill | Organiser creates; a friend pays a share straight to the organiser; closing works | PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator): 6 Oct, the fork, `demo:e2e:split` 22 of 22 (Maya creates, Sam and Priya pay shares straight to her account, a relayed share replayed pays nothing more, closing cancels the rest, a split by amounts settles) | |
| F8 | Sealed receipt | The server holds ciphertext only; the app opens it with the passkey's inbox key | PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator): 6 Oct, the fork: ciphertext only to the app's signed request; the passkey's keys open it (again in the Boost run) | |
| F9 | Collections | A due instalment is collected on chain (CRE collections code, Chainlink's forwarder on the fork) | PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator): 6 Oct, the fork, `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1`: the CRE collections workflow (local runner, reports through Chainlink's MockKeystoneForwarder) collected instalment 1 of the Boost-backed plan a minute after checkout (1 of 4 paid, read back through the API) | |
| F10 | Lost approval → sign again | The buyer re-signs; the retry collects at once | not run | |
| F11 | Guardian pause | A raised threshold pauses new Pay in 4 ("Threshold raised for demo"); resumes after | not run | |
| F12 | Mid-flow interruption | Closing the checkout popup leaves no charge and a retryable session | not run | |
| F13 | API down | The app shows a retryable error, no fake success | not run | |
| F14 | Insufficient balance | Pay now refused before signing with a clear message | not run | |
| F15 | Add to Boost | From Select account → Boost, the Credit line's Boost row or desktop Credit: amount > balance or < $0.10 can't continue; one Face ID; relayed `CollateralVault.lockWithPermit` (permit spender = the vault, value = the amount); `lockedOf` +amount, dollar balance −amount, `creditLimitOf` up by ≤ 1.5× the amount; the success sheet shows the new Boost and limit read from chain; buyer holds 0 MON | PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator) from the desktop Credit page's Add to Boost: 6 Oct, the fork: $351 on the keypad (computed from the price, `quotePlan` and the vault multiplier as ScoreManager applies it), one Face ID; `lockedOf` +$351.00, dollar balance −$351.00, `creditLimitOf` $0 → $351 (face value: not underwritten, so ≤ 1.5×); Boosted. shows $351.00 in Boost and $0.00 → $351.00 read back from the chain. Not exercised here: the other two entry points, the amount limits (unit tests only), the buyer's MON after the lock | |
| F16 | Take out of Boost | From the Boost sheet's Take out (the Credit line's row, the desktop Credit page's button, or Add/Take out in any Boost sheet): while a Pay in 4 plan is open, the sheet says the Boost secures it and offers no amount (`withdrawable` 0); once nothing is owed, an amount ≤ `withdrawable`, ≥ $0.10 and leaving 0 or ≥ $0.10 behind; one Face ID signs the vault's EIP-712 `Withdraw`; relayed `CollateralVault.withdrawWithSig`; `lockedOf` −amount, the vault's dollars −amount, the buyer's dollar balance +amount, sent by the relayer, buyer holds 0 MON; "Taken out." shows Boost, the limit and the balance read from chain. On a vault without `withdrawWithSig` (Monad testnet today): "Taking them out isn't available on this network yet", nothing signed | PASS (automated, `demo:e2e`, virtual authenticator) from the desktop Credit page's Take out of Boost: 7 Oct, the fork, `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1`: with the plan open ($261.75 owed) the sheet said the Boost secures it, no keypad, `withdrawable` $0.00; once the collections run repaid it, $25 on the keypad, one Face ID; at the withdrawal's block `lockedOf` $351.00 → $326.00, the vault −$25.00, the buyer +$25.00, sent by the relayer (`withdrawWithSig`), the buyer at 0 MON and 0 transactions sent; Taken out. shows $326.00 in Boost, $351.00 → $326.00, $418.00 in the dollar account. Not exercised here: the other entry points, the testnet copy (unit tests and the relayer's `withdraw_unavailable` test only; testnet's vault is frozen), the amount limits (unit tests only) | |
