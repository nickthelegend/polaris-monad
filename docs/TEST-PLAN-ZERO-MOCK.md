# Zero-mock test plan

Every page, endpoint, on-chain interaction and integration of Polaris, with
what "correct" means for each. Run through a real browser (Claude in Chrome)
against the real local stack: an anvil fork of Monad testnet with Agora's
AUSD, real contracts, real signed transactions, the real SQLite store, the
real APIs. On every item the console has no errors and the network tab has
no failed request the product didn't expect. Status is one of **PASS**,
**FAIL** (with the fix), or **UNTESTED** (with the exact missing
dependency); never PASS on an assumption. See [`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) P4.

**Stack under test.** `demo:local` in fork mode on its own ports (PLAN P2.1).
Buyers sign in with a real WebAuthn ceremony: Claude in Chrome uses the
person's own platform authenticator (Touch ID) when they are present; the
automated run (`demo:e2e`) uses Chrome's virtual authenticator with PRF, so
Mera's own code derives every key. Monad testnet itself is on hold: items
that need it are UNTESTED, "awaiting testnet go".

Legend for the run columns: **R1** first full run, **R2** the re-run after
fixes.

## L. Landing page (`apps/landing`)

## A. The Polaris app: screens (`apps/app`)

| ID | Item | Correct means | R1 | R2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Not configured | Built without `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLARIS_API_URL`: a "not configured" screen, no balances or activity invented | not run | |
| A2 | `/onboard` | Continue with Face ID starts a WebAuthn create with PRF; email (Privy) shown only when configured | not run | |
| A3 | Home `/` | Balance read from the chain for the signed-in account; activity from the API; empty state for a new account | not run | |
| A4 | `/activity`, `/activity/[id]` | Lists real payments, plans, sends; a detail opens; unknown id shows "not found" | not run | |
| A5 | `/credit`, `/credit/score` | The on-chain credit line and its reasons; "Raise your limit" names a missing provider honestly | not run | |
| A6 | `/plans`, `/plans/[id]` | Open plans with the next instalment from the chain | not run | |

| A13 | `/accounts`, `/cards`, `/insights`, `/notifications`, `/profile`, `/settings` | Each renders real data or an honest empty state; no dead buttons | not run | |
| A14 | Sheets (`@sheet/*`) | Each sheet opens over its screen and closes; deep link opens the full page | not run | |
| A15 | `/gallery` | Not reachable in a production build (development only) | not run | |
| A16 | 375 px, every screen | No overflow, tappable targets, safe areas | not run | |
| A17 | `/api/fx` | Chainlink rates read live (server-side), with age; a currency with no feed → no line | not run | |

| A19 | `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` | Served as JSON with the configured fingerprint, or 404 when unset | not run | |

## F. The Polaris app: flows

| ID | Flow | Correct means | R1 | R2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Face ID sign-up | One ceremony; Mera derives the account; reload and storage clear → same account from the passkey | not run | |
| F2 | Pay now from a link | One confirm; relayed `PolarisCheckout.pay` on the fork; buyer −amount, merchant +amount −0.5%; receipt shown; buyer holds 0 MON | not run | |
| F3 | Pay in 4 | Plan opens on chain against the credit line; merchant paid in full from the pool; 4 × instalments shown | UNTESTED (no provider keys in the run, so no line opened) | |
| F4 | Raise your limit | With no Nansen/Zerion key: says which provider isn't configured; never a line from invented data | PASS (6 Oct, `demo:e2e` on the fork: names Zerion, Etherscan and Nansen as not set up; on-chain limit stays $0) | |
| F5 | Subscribe | First period charged on chain; cancel stops the next | not run | |
| F6 | Send by link → claim | Escrowed in PolarisSend; claim pays the recipient once; sender cancel works before claim | not run | |
| F7 | Split the bill | Organiser creates; a friend pays a share straight to the organiser; closing works | not run | |
| F8 | Sealed receipt | The server holds ciphertext only; the app opens it with the passkey's inbox key | PASS (6 Oct, `demo:e2e` on the fork: ciphertext only to the app's signed request; the passkey's keys open it) | |
| F9 | Collections | A due instalment is collected on chain (CRE collections code, Chainlink's forwarder on the fork) | UNTESTED (no plan opened in the 6 Oct fork run; no provider keys) | |
| F10 | Lost approval → sign again | The buyer re-signs; the retry collects at once | not run | |
| F11 | Guardian pause | A raised threshold pauses new Pay in 4 ("Threshold raised for demo"); resumes after | not run | |
| F12 | Mid-flow interruption | Closing the checkout popup leaves no charge and a retryable session | not run | |
| F13 | API down | The app shows a retryable error, no fake success | not run | |
| F14 | Insufficient balance | Pay now refused before signing with a clear message | not run | |
| F15 | Add to Boost | From Select account → Boost, the Credit line's Boost row or desktop Credit: amount > balance or < $0.10 can't continue; one Face ID; relayed `CollateralVault.lockWithPermit` (permit spender = the vault, value = the amount); `lockedOf` +amount, dollar balance −amount, `creditLimitOf` up by ≤ 1.5× the amount; the success sheet shows the new Boost and limit read from chain; buyer holds 0 MON | not run | |
| F16 | Take out of Boost | Not offered: the deployed vault's `withdraw` pays `msg.sender` only, so no relayer can carry it; the Boost sheet says taking dollars out isn't in the app yet (correct = that line shows, and no withdraw button exists) | not run | |
