# The demo video: three minutes

The rules ask for a public video of 3 minutes or less that shows the product
working and its Monad integration ([`sources.md`](sources.md#the-rules)).
This is [`docs/plan.md` §8](../plan.md#8-demo-three-minutes) rewritten for
what the repository does today: the Halcyon shop, the Polaris checkout, Pay in
4 with Chainlink CRE underwriting, the merchant dashboard, send by link and
claim with the local-currency line, the Chainlink guardian and the instant
retry, and on Monad testnet the CRE reports and the gasless run through the
Privy relayer.

**Total: 3:00.** Nine scenes, recorded in three takes, cut together.

## Rules for the recording

These keep the video honest; each one matches a label the product already
shows.

1. **Keep the "Dev signer · not Face ID" badge on screen** in every app shot
   from `pnpm demo:local`, and show the caption *Local demo chain · a dev
   signer stands in for Face ID* the first time it appears. If the app is
   hosted on HTTPS by then ([README, step 6](../../README.md#what-only-you-can-do)),
   record scene 3 on an iPhone with real Face ID instead and drop the caption.
2. **Say which chain each shot is on.** Scenes 2 to 7 are the local Hardhat
   chain (the guardian's price is read live from Monad mainnet); scene 8 is
   Monad testnet. Local receipts link nowhere; never show a
   local hash as if it were on an explorer.
3. **The guardian's pause is a moved threshold, never a faked price.** Every
   paused shot carries *Threshold raised for demo*.
4. **The credit line says who delivered its report.** On the local chain it
   reads "CRE workflow, local run"; do not caption it "Verified by Chainlink
   CRE".
5. **The underwriting evidence is live or absent**, never sample data: on
   the local chain too, a provider without its key is "not configured" and
   Raise your limit says which key it needs. Record the underwriting scenes
   with the keys set, or show that message as it is.
6. **Local currency is indicative**, as the line itself says.
7. **The buyer's scenes use the buyer's words**: account, Face ID, confirm,
   dollars. Monad, Chainlink and CRE are named only in captions and in the
   scenes for judges (6 to 8).

## Before recording

```bash
pnpm install
# once, for scene 8 only, if you record live runs (see Take C)
pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows cre:install
pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows cre login
```

- **Screen:** 1440×900 for the shop, the app on desktop and the dashboard;
  a phone-sized window (390×844: Chrome DevTools device mode, or a narrow
  window) for the claim.
- **Browsers:** profile 1 is the buyer and sender (the shop, the app, the
  dashboard in tabs). A fresh incognito window is the person who claims, so
  they arrive with no account.
- **Local currency:** in profile 1, open the app's Settings and pick the
  Argentine peso, or start Chrome with `--lang=es-AR` (the app follows the
  browser's language: [`apps/app` README, "Local currency"](../../apps/app/README.md#local-currency)).
- **A clock** in a screen corner for scenes 2 to 4, so the first-five-minutes
  claim is timed on camera rather than asserted.
- **The Android app, if it can be shown live.** Only once the app is hosted
  and the APK is on an Android phone ([README, step 8](../../README.md#what-only-you-can-do)):
  then add a two-second insert to scene 5 of the Android app opening on the
  phone, captioned *The Polaris Android app · Monad testnet* (the hosted app
  is on testnet, so keep it apart from the local claim). Until then scene 5
  stays as written.

### The three takes

| Take | Start with | For scenes | Why a separate take |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | `pnpm demo:local` | 1 to 5 | Real weekly terms: Pay in 4 at 10% APR, $349 as 4 × $87.92 ([`apps/shop/README.md`](../../apps/shop/README.md#run-it-against-the-real-polaris-backend)) |
| **B** | `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1 pnpm demo:local` | 6 and 7 | Instalments a minute apart, so a collection, a lost approval and the instant retry happen on camera. Interest pro-rated over minutes shows as $0.00; do not show this take's checkout as the pricing |
| **C** | Monad testnet: the committed CRE runs and the committed gasless run through Privy, or live CLI loops | 8 | The Monad testnet evidence |

`pnpm demo:local` ([`scripts/demo-local.mjs`](../../scripts/demo-local.mjs))
prints its URLs when every page has compiled: the shop at
http://127.0.0.1:3600, the app at http://localhost:3000, the dashboard at
http://localhost:3100/dashboard (signed in for Halcyon). Stop one take with
Ctrl+C before starting the next; each run starts fresh.

## The scenes

Each scene lists the shots, the exact on-screen text (captions we add are in
*italics*; words the product shows are in quotes, as they read in the
reference captures), the voiceover, the command that sets it up, and a
reference capture of the frame to aim for.

### 1. The problem (0:00–0:10)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | Title card on black, then the Polaris landing page |
| On screen | *Every app that sells something needs Stripe.* then *Polaris: Stripe for every app on Monad.* |
| Voiceover | "Every app that sells something needs Stripe. On Monad, a buyer still needs a wallet, gas and the full price up front. Polaris fixes all three." |
| Command | Take A running; the landing page is `pnpm --filter @polaris/landing dev` (port 3200) |
| Reference | [`x-1280-landing.png`](../demo/x-1280-landing.png) |

### 2. Halcyon: check out with Polaris (0:10–0:25)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | Halcyon home → Halcyon One ($349, "or 4 × $87.92") → Add to bag → Check out → Payment: Polaris, **Pay in 4** → "Pay $349.00 with Polaris" → the Polaris pop-up opens |
| On screen | *Halcyon: a demo store. It takes payment through polarispay-sdk.* |
| Voiceover | "Halcyon sells headphones. It added Polaris with our SDK. Lena, in Berlin, wants to pay in four." |
| Command | Take A; open http://127.0.0.1:3600 |
| Reference | [`25-newbuyer-1-shop-product.png`](../demo/25-newbuyer-1-shop-product.png), [`25-newbuyer-3-shop-checkout.png`](../demo/25-newbuyer-3-shop-checkout.png) |

### 3. The Polaris checkout: a new buyer, Pay in 4, the limit (0:25–0:55)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | The pop-up on Pay in 4 → "Raise your limit" ("We read the history of a wallet you already use. Nothing moves from it.") → "Continue with Face ID" → "Your limit went up" "$1,000", with its reasons ("First topped up from a major exchange · from Nansen") → back on the checkout: "Pay in 4" "$87.92 × 4", "Due today" "$0.00" → Confirm → the receipt |
| On screen | *Local demo chain · a dev signer stands in for Face ID* (with the badge visible). *One tap creates the account: no password, no seed phrase, nothing to install.* *The limit comes from a Chainlink CRE workflow; the chain computes the score. Sample history in this local run.* |
| Voiceover | "One tap and she has an account. Polaris reads the history of a wallet she already uses, and gives her a thousand-dollar limit, with the reasons. Four payments, nothing today. Confirm." |
| Command | Take A (the underwriting runs through `trigger:local`, started by `demo:local`) |
| Reference | [`25-newbuyer-4-app-checkout-popup.png`](../demo/25-newbuyer-4-app-checkout-popup.png), [`25-newbuyer-5-raise-your-limit.png`](../demo/25-newbuyer-5-raise-your-limit.png), [`20-payin4-6-limit-raised.png`](../demo/20-payin4-6-limit-raised.png), [`20-payin4-8-app-confirm.png`](../demo/20-payin4-8-app-confirm.png), [`20-payin4-8b-app-receipt.png`](../demo/20-payin4-8b-app-receipt.png) |

The captures show $87.25 × 4 and $0.00 interest because they came from a
`DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1` run; take A shows the weekly $87.92.

### 4. The merchant: paid in full, the plan on the dashboard (0:55–1:10)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | The pop-up closes; Halcyon's order page: "Thank you, Lena." with "Polaris · Pay in 4" "Paid" and four payments → the dashboard's Pay in 4 page: "Paid to you up front", "100% at checkout", the plan's four tick marks, and "How Pay in 4 works": "A $200.00 order" "4 × $50.38" "10% APR" |
| On screen | *Halcyon is paid in full, up front. Polaris carries the credit and collects the four payments.* |
| Voiceover | "Halcyon is paid in full, right away. Polaris carries the credit, and collects the four payments." |
| Command | Take A; the dashboard at http://localhost:3100/dashboard, **Pay in 4** |
| Reference | [`20-payin4-9-shop-order-plan.png`](../demo/20-payin4-9-shop-order-plan.png), [`43-dashboard-pay-in-4.png`](../demo/43-dashboard-pay-in-4.png) |

### 5. Send by link and claim, in pesos (1:10–1:40)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | The app on desktop (profile 1, pesos): Home → Send → type 12.50 → the line under the amount: "≈ ARS … · Chainlink rate, … · indicative" → Send (the name is asked once: "Maya") → "Link ready." "Whoever opens it gets $12.50." → Copy → the incognito phone window opens the link: "You've got dollars" "$12.50" "from Maya" → "Claim $12.50" → "Arrived." "Fee" "None" → back in profile 1: "Your link was claimed" |
| On screen | *Maya, in Buenos Aires, sends $12.50 by link. The pesos are at Chainlink's USD/ARS rate, for reference only.* *Whoever opens the link gets the dollars: no account needed first, no fee.* |
| Voiceover | "Maya sends twelve dollars fifty to a friend abroad. She sees it in pesos, and shares a link. Her friend opens it, taps once, and it has arrived. No bank, no fee." |
| Command | Take A. Off camera first, fund profile 1's account: **Add money** offers the local faucet's test dollars on this chain (Pay in 4 took nothing at checkout) |
| Reference | [`01-fx-send-ars.png`](../demo/chainlink/01-fx-send-ars.png), [`x-1440-send-link-ready.png`](../demo/x-1440-send-link-ready.png), [`x-390-claim-open.png`](../demo/x-390-claim-open.png), [`x-390-claim-arrived.png`](../demo/x-390-claim-arrived.png), [`x-1440-notifications.png`](../demo/x-1440-notifications.png) |

### 6. The Chainlink guardian pauses and resumes Pay in 4 (1:40–2:10)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | The dashboard's **Chainlink** page: "Risk guard", "Pay in 4 is open", "AUSD/USD (CRE attestation)" at about $0.9998 → a terminal: `guard raise` → (cut the wait for the next guardian run) → "Pay in 4 is paused" "AUSD/USD left its band" → Halcyon's checkout: "Pay in 4" "Paused", "Pay in 4 is paused by our risk guard; pay now works as usual." → **Pay now** goes through → terminal: `guard restore` → the dashboard: "Pay in 4 is open" again |
| On screen | *polaris-guardian, a Chainlink CRE workflow, reads Chainlink's AUSD/USD on Monad mainnet every minute.* *Threshold raised for demo: the owner moves the depeg bar to $1.001. The price is real.* *Only new Pay in 4 plans pause. Pay now keeps working.* |
| Voiceover | "Credit only opens while the dollar holds its peg. A Chainlink CRE workflow reads the real AUSD price on Monad mainnet and reports to our contracts. For the demo we move the bar above today's price: new Pay in 4 plans pause, and Pay now keeps working. Put it back, and credit reopens." |
| Command | Take B: `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1 pnpm demo:local`, then `node scripts/demo-chainlink.mjs guard raise` (it waits for the guardian's attestation) and, after the Pay now shot, `node scripts/demo-chainlink.mjs guard restore`. `guard status` prints the guard's state at any time ([`scripts/demo-chainlink.mjs`](../../scripts/demo-chainlink.mjs)) |
| Reference | [`18-dashboard-chainlink-workflows.png`](../demo/chainlink/18-dashboard-chainlink-workflows.png), [`08-dashboard-chainlink-paused.png`](../demo/chainlink/08-dashboard-chainlink-paused.png), [`10-paused-shop-checkout.png`](../demo/chainlink/10-paused-shop-checkout.png), [`11-paused-pay-now-still-works.png`](../demo/chainlink/11-paused-pay-now-still-works.png), [`12-dashboard-chainlink-resumed.png`](../demo/chainlink/12-dashboard-chainlink-resumed.png) |

### 7. Sign again: the instant retry (2:10–2:30)

Set up off camera, in take B, before scene 6's pause (a paused guard refuses
new plans):

1. In profile 1, buy at Halcyon with Pay in 4 (as in scenes 2 and 3). With
   `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1` the first payment falls due about a minute later.
2. Within that minute, revoke the buyer's approval (the buyer's own
   transaction, as a wallet's "revoke" would):
   `DEMO_BUYER_KEY=<the app's dev signer key> node scripts/demo-chainlink.mjs lose-approval`.
   The key is the local dev signer's, in profile 1's DevTools → Application →
   Local Storage → `polaris.dev-signer.v1`. Do this off camera; never show it.
3. The collections cron's next run cannot collect ("allowance_lost"), and the
   app asks the buyer to sign again.
4. Record scene 7 within 15 minutes of that missed payment:
   `DEMO_FAST_PLANS=1` sets a 15-minute grace, after which the collections run
   liquidates the plan. Scene 6 fits in between (Pay now, and signing again,
   work while Pay in 4 is paused).

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | The app's Home: "Sign again to pay your instalment" → "Sign again" → Confirm → the plan: "Collected" "Your payment went through 2 s after you signed." → the terminal tailing `.demo/logs/cre-collections.log`: the "log trigger: Reauthorized" line, then "log written: 1 checked, 1 collected" → the dashboard's Chainlink page listing it as an instant retry |
| On screen | *A payment failed because an approval was reset. One confirm, and a Chainlink CRE log trigger collects it in about 2 seconds, not at the next retry 6 hours later.* |
| Voiceover | "If a payment can't be taken, the buyer signs once, and the collection runs on the next block, instead of hours later." |
| Command | Take B, after the three steps above. The log: `tail -f .demo/logs/cre-collections.log` |
| Reference | [`14-app-home-sign-again.png`](../demo/chainlink/14-app-home-sign-again.png), [`16-app-sign-again-confirm.png`](../demo/chainlink/16-app-sign-again-confirm.png), [`17-app-plan-collected.png`](../demo/chainlink/17-app-plan-collected.png), [`19-dashboard-chainlink-runs.png`](../demo/chainlink/19-dashboard-chainlink-runs.png) |

### 8. On Monad testnet: the CRE reports, gasless through Privy (2:30–2:50)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | A terminal with the CRE CLI's run of the log trigger ("Reauthorized: … re-signed", "wrote 1 tasks, gas limit 326965 (estimate 284318)", "collect #1 ok") → Monadscan: the report transaction [`0x1116fbb4…292c4d`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0x1116fbb4b53263776da4c5cc6d7984b66f1d31ac81f35215b5dcf246f1292c4d) (to Chainlink's forwarder, `ReportProcessed` for `CollectionsReceiver`) → the guardian's run ("Chainlink AUSD / USD on monad-mainnet: 0.99982194", "GuardianReceiver accepted it: feed round 1, Pay in 4 open") → Monadscan [`0x015bd95d…3f9080`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0x015bd95da145efb4884ea0e50730728a2023a15f890f737847ede4064e3f9080) → the Privy relayer's page on Monadscan, [`0x8366…6aE2`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/address/0x8366916019bc5452e62A0D36418ABebB45396aE2), its transactions to PolarisCheckout, PolarisSend and the rest from the 14-of-14 run → one of them, the claim of a send link [`0x30ee0025…c8119a`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/tx/0x30ee00250e065a8081da4360c5c18ed9a123d2bc57d65413d8ae8e6030c8119a) → the PolarisCheckout contract page [`0x3874…C70B`](https://testnet.monadscan.com/address/0x3874ef1bcE222755525a96f8284631780b9bC70B), its **Contract** tab showing the verified source |
| On screen | *Monad testnet, 28 Sep 2026: `cre workflow simulate --broadcast`, three reports delivered through Chainlink's forwarder.* *Gas limit = estimate + 15%: Monad charges for the limit.* *The relayer is a Privy server wallet, locked by a policy. Five test accounts signed every step and never held MON.* *Every contract's source is verified.* |
| Voiceover | "This is the same code on Monad testnet. The CRE CLI ran our workflows and delivered three signed reports. And every payment here was carried by a Privy server wallet, locked to our contracts: the users only signed." |
| Command | Take C: see below |
| Reference | [`collections-retry-081620.log`](../../workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/collections-retry-081620.log), [`guardian-081657.log`](../../workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/guardian-081657.log), [`workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/README.md`](../../workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/README.md), the gasless run [`docs/demo/testnet/README.md`](../demo/testnet/README.md) |

**Take C, recorded (costs nothing, recommended).** Show the committed runs
from 28 Sep 2026 and open their transactions on Monadscan (the gasless run's
19 are listed in [`docs/demo/testnet/README.md`](../demo/testnet/README.md)):

```bash
cat workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/collections-retry-081620.log
cat workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/guardian-081657.log
```

Caption the date. The CLI's own log lines are stamped 5 h 30 min ahead of
the UTC times the evidence script recorded (they appear to be the machine's
local time, marked "Z"), so quote times from
[`runs.json`](../../workflows/evidence/2026-09-28/runs.json), not the log.

**Take C, live (only if the team decides to).** These send real
transactions to Monad testnet from the CRE transmitter key in
`workflows/.env` (`CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`, funded with 1 testnet MON on 28 Sep), and
need `cre login` ([`workflows/README.md`, "Simulate"](../../workflows/README.md#simulate)):

```bash
pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows collections:loop --broadcast   # polaris-collections every minute
pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows guardian:loop --broadcast      # polaris-guardian every minute
pnpm --filter @polaris/cre-workflows retry:listen --broadcast       # collections' log trigger, live
```

Each run is appended to `workflows/evidence/loop/`. Plan #1 on testnet was
already collected and liquidated on 28 Sep; plan #2, from the run through
Privy, is the only other plan, and no CRE run in the committed evidence has
touched it, so check what is due before filming. A new testnet plan needs
`pnpm --filter @polaris/business smoke:testnet -- --run`, which spends the
Privy relayer's and the deployer's testnet MON. The guardian writes only when
something changed or its heartbeat is due. An idle run writes nothing, which
is correct but not much to film.

### 9. For developers, and the close (2:50–3:00)

| | |
|---|---|
| Shots | The integration code from [`packages/sdk/README.md`](../../packages/sdk/README.md) (a checkout session and a webhook check) → end card |
| On screen | End card: **Polaris** · *Stripe for every app on Monad.* · *github.com/nickthelegend/polaris-monad* · *Built on Monad with Agora AUSD, Privy, Chainlink CRE, Nansen, Mera and Envio.* |
| Voiceover | "Ten lines to take payments. Polaris: Stripe for every app on Monad." |
| Command | none |

Sponsor names on the end card are plain text unless each sponsor's logo
guidelines allow their use.

## After recording

1. Upload publicly (YouTube, Loom or Vimeo) and put the link in
   [`writeup.md`](writeup.md) (`<VIDEO_URL>`), [`profile.md`](profile.md) and
   [`bounty-fields.md`](bounty-fields.md).
2. Replace the `[m:ss]` timestamps in [`bounty-fields.md`](bounty-fields.md)
   with the cut's real ones. They are this script's timeline until then.
3. Keep the source takes: if a judge asks, each claim in the video maps to a
   file or transaction in [`writeup.md`](writeup.md).
